## Folder Structure

The workspace contains some folders where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `assets`: the folder containing assets

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
